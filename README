//Passing event to backup tag:value
1. Tag each volume with a 'Backup' tag that has the value of 'Schedule'
2. make an event.json for each 'Schedule' type
3. test with claudia using 'claudia test-lambda --event ./testing/Event-BackupDaily.json'
4. Make a CloudWatch Event
  4a. It should mirror the schedule for your event.json test ('0 22 * * ? *' is 22:00 UTC every day)
  4b. It should send a constant JSON that matches the text from our event.json
  4c. Suggested name is something like 'SnapMarshal-Backup-Daily'
  4d. Suggested Description is like 'Calls SnapMarshal to make a snapshot every 1 day'
